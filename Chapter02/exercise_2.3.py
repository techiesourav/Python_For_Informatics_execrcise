# Exercise 2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to
#              compute gross pay.
#               Enter Hours: 35
#               Enter Rate: 2.75
#               Pay: 96.25


# We wonâ€™t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal
# place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function
# to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.

# this program is basic, so does not perform any error checking
# the advanced version will do the same #TODO

hours = raw_input("Enter Hours: ")
rate = raw_input("Enter Rate: ")

# type conversion

hours = float(hours)
rate = float(rate)

pay = hours * rate

print 'Pay: ', pay
